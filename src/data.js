    description:
      "Implemented wireless remote control capability to a 3D printed model Cybertruck, using C++, ESP32 microcontroller/ESPNOW communication protocol, and Arduino IDE.",
    summary:  "The purpose of this project was to implement a wireless remote control subsystem to pilot and steer the 3D-printed model Cybertruck. This was achieved using two ESP32 microcontrollers. The first ESP32 was programmed to read and digitize values from an analog joystick. These values were then mapped and adjusted to account for deadband and direction. After this, the data was transmitted to the second ESP32, which served as the receiving microcontroller. Data transmission between the ESP32 devices was facilitated by the ESPNOW communication protocol, a low-power, low-latency wireless communication method that enables direct peer-to-peer data transmission without requiring a Wi-Fi network. On the receiving end, the joystick data was processed by a function that determined the direction of motor rotation based on which range the data for each axis fell into (e.g., 0-75, 75-175), thus controlling the Cybertruck's movement. Similar to the transmitting ESP32, which took analog data as input and produced digital output, the receiving ESP32 converted the digitized input into Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) signals. PWM is a technique used to control the amount of power delivered to an electronic device by varying the width of pulses in a pulse train. This effectively adjusts the signal's duty cycle to represent different power levelsâ€”in this case, speed. These PWM signals were then sent from the receiving ESP32 microcontroller to channels on a motor driver. The positive and negative terminals of each motor were connected to their respective left or right channels on the motor driver to receive the correct PWM signals. With this setup, the wireless remote control subsystem was successfully implemented, allowing for precise control of the Cybertruck.",

    subtitle: "Made from scratch Overdrive Guitar Effect Pedal",
    description:
      "Developed an 'Overdrive' Guitar Effect Pedal from scratch, using a combination of Active & Passive electronics components to manipulate an electric guitar's waveform.",
      summary: "This project involved designing and building a simple overdrive guitar pedal to emulate the sound of a guitar amplifier being pushed to its limits using a soft-clipping circuit. Unlike distortion pedals that use hard-clipping, the overdrive pedal employed diodes in a feedback loop with a TL081 op-amp to achieve a smoother gain, preserving the natural dynamics of the guitar signal. The design included variable gain and volume controls, providing flexibility in the intensity and loudness of the overdrive effect. The circuit was first simulated using the Falstad Online Circuit Simulator with a 400Hz sine wave input and then physically prototyped and tested with an electric guitar and amplifier setup. Various configurations were tested, revealing a range of sound characteristics from clean to heavily overdriven, depending on the gain and volume settings. The project successfully demonstrated practical applications of electronics principles in audio signal processing, resulting in a functional and cost-effective overdrive pedal that showcased a fundamental understanding of microelectronics, filtering, and acoustics.",
